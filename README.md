Record songs with only your voice - no instruments required!
=========

This is a web application that uses your voice as a substitute for instruments.  You can sing or beatbox into your microphone, and the app will convert the sounds into the instrument of your choice.  

How to use
==========
* Click the big yellow button to add tracks.
* Chose what type of track you want to use: instruments, drums, or live vocals (currently in development)
* Select the instrument you'd like to use.
* Sing!
* Wait for it...
* Layer more tracks for more tunage.
* Change the tempo with the arrows around the BPM indicator.
* Make an account to save and load songs.
* Export your tune to mp3 or midi (currently in development)
